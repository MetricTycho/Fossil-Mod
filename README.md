# Fossil-Mod

This mod adds a new kind of ore to the game: Fossils.
They are naturally found in sandstone, making otherwise useless desert biomes attractive for prospecting.

Whenever you dig a fossil-block, it either breaks to sand/coal or is preserved by chance.
When 9 fossils of the same species are gained, the can be sold (crafted to diamonds)
The prize depends on how rare the fossil is.
